<b> Mission Statement </b><br/>
Independent developers do not have the resources to do their own market research. We are creating a tool that provides these developers with a platform, to expedite their own market research, based on convenient access to aggregated Steam game data.

<b>Target User<b><br/>
The independent game developer, who is looking to gain a strategic edge, by using information that is already available.
